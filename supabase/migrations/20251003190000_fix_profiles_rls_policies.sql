  # Fix Profiles RLS Policies

  ## Changes
  - Remove conflicting and redundant RLS policies on profiles table
  - Keep only simple, non-recursive policies that allow:
    - All authenticated users can view all profiles (SELECT)
    - Users can update their own profile (UPDATE)
    - Users can insert their own profile on signup (INSERT)
    - Admins can insert any profile (INSERT)
    - Admins can delete profiles (DELETE)

  ## Security
  - No recursion in policies
  - Clear and simple permission model
  - Maintains data security while fixing 406 errors
